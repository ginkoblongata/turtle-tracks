<p>
<b>Turtle Tracks</b> is a modern Logo interpreter and runtime environment written entirely in Java. It is not a direct port of an existing interpreter, but written from the ground up specifically for Java, and designed to take advantage of the strengths of Java as a language and environment. Turtle Tracks is platform-independent and Internet-ready, and supports numerous advanced features such as multithreading and networking. Unlike similar projects such as Bongo, Turtle Tracks is true Logo and supports the same Logo syntax and the same primitives as other Logo implementations. It also supports plug-in primitive sets and should, in the future, allow integration with outside Java code as a scripting language.
